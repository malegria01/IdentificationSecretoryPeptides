# Computational Analysis of Signal Peptides Interacting with SecA in *Escherichia coli*

## Project Description
This repository contains the computational pipeline and data used for the identification and analysis of novel signal peptides (SPs) that interact with the SecA protein in Escherichia coli, as detailed in our study. This research explores the use of various bioinformatic tools to predict and model interactions between SPs and the Sec-pathway, with a focus on enhancing the efficiency of recombinant protein secretion.

## Data Description
This project utilizes the following datasets:

- Raw Data: Proteome extracted from UniProt database.

- Processed Data: Interactions and scores generated by HADDOCK and other tools.


## Methodology

The computational pipeline includes:

## 1. Protein Sequence Analysis

### Input
Proteome extracted from the UniProt database. Access the data [here](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10971817).

### 1.1 Protein Filtering Process
This [Jupyter notebook](/notebooks/1.2_Proteome_analysis_Sec_pathway_positionformatting.ipynb) demonstrates the steps to process the input file `1.1_Secretome_database_validated_EColi_GFFfile.gff`. The algorithm filters out only experimentally validated SP-bearing proteins, reported as involved in cell secretion via the Sec-pathway, using Python.

### 1.2 Output File
The resulting [output file](/data/1.2_Input_for_uniprot_IDmapping.txt) contains a dataset listing 141 identified proteins. Each entry is labeled with UniProt IDs and the amino acid positions of SPs. The format for each entry is `P0AEG4[1-20]`, where `P0AEG4` is the protein ID and `[1-20]` indicates the SP amino acid positions in brackets.

### 1.3 Retrieval and Analysis of Toxin Signal Peptides
Signal peptides associated with toxins (GO:0003824) from the proteome of gram-negative bacteria (taxonomy: Proteobacteria) were retrieved from the UniProt database, including both reviewed and hypothetical protein sequences. Access the sequences [here](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10971817). Subsequently, these sequences were processed using SignalP to predict signal peptides:

```bash
signalp6 --fastafile [input.fasta] --organism other --output_dir [outputDir] --format txt --mode fasta
```




Filtering and preparation of sequences.

    Molecular Docking: Using HADDOCK for interaction prediction.
    Post-analysis: Energy calculations and structural evaluations.
